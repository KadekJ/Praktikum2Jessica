            This... is Berk. The best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere.
            Granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs 
            more than a few surprises.Life here is amazing, just not for the faint
            of heart.

            This... is Berk. A bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, 
            but it's home. It's our home. Those who attacked us are relentless and
             crazy. But those who stopped them? Oh, even more so!
